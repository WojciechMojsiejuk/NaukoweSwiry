 One english word can be used to translate many polish words. This function makes sure that every word will display only once.

 Both functions are used to put structure to text files. If chosen option is Print_Database_PL file which was created
 can be used once more as a database (it's syntax is suitable to be read by this program).
 In case of Print_Database_ENG it is also created to match syntax,
 however if uploaded english words are treated as polish words and vice versa.
 This program was created as a Polish-English dictionary, every other use is thus not recommended.
